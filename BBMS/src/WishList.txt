3DEC14:

* Add save/load functionality
* Add unit GUI (?)
* Terrain editing (?)
* Elevation and relief (?)
* More efficient circular LOS?  
* LOS over a particular view arc?
* Varying move cost per terrain / fine grained clock
* Real time clock functionality

[Static]
* Clustering / preprocessing
* Integration of a NN
* Training for NN for formation recognition

[Spatiotemporal clustering]

[The Scouting Problem]
* Spatiotemporal clustering --> gas diffusion model --> projecting enemy location in the future
* Identify OP positions to observe (particularly decision points) - maybe some input based on hexes you 
  can observe and likelihood of enemy presence?  Perhaps the variance in the sub vectors for gas diffusion?
* Spotting ranges, enemy can "kill" you - factors concealment of where you're at, possible escape vector?
